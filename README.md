# og3x-satellite

This library helps build a satellite architecure of a base station and satellite sensors. A protobuf-based packet system is used to allow satellite devices to send information about themselves and to send readings. This library is meant to work with the [og3](https://github.com/chl33/og3) library for ESP projects, using the Arduino framework with [Platformio](https://platformio.org/).

This library is still a work in progress.
