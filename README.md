# og3x-satellite

This library helps build a satellite architecture of a base station and satellite sensors. A protobuf-based packet system is used to allow satellite devices to send information about themselves and to send readings. This library is meant to work with the [og3](https://github.com/chl33/og3) library for ESP projects, using the Arduino framework with [Platformio](https://platformio.org/).

This library is used by these projects:
- [LoRa133](https://github.com/chl33/LoRa133)
- [Garden133](https://github.com/chl33/Garden133)

Please see the [Introducing Garden133](https://selectiveappeal.org/posts/garden133/) blog post.
for a project overview.

This library is still a work in progress.
